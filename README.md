The goal of this script is to automate the process of builiding the tools needed for an operational Openvas v10 Scanner.
It is currently only written for current (May 2019) Debian Stretch.
I'm open to any and all ideas on how to make this more useful. 

TODO: 
   Work with RPM based distro.
   Create valid systemd unit files
   Create certificates for gsad
